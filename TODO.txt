Anthill.cs - Create texture

Ants - add collision detection
Ants - unit circle and vector clamp functions shouldn't be part of ant file

CREATE FOOD
    Food can have a very simple texture
    ants should sense food in some way and want to move toward it
    ants should pick up food when colliding with it
    While holding food, ants should seek out anthill (pheromones)
    While not holding food, ants should seek out food (pheromones)

CREATE PHEROMONES 
    Ants should generate pheromones based on their state 
    States (for now) are simply holding food and seeking food
        (my add more later)
    

Ants - add some kind of sight (detect food, anthill)
